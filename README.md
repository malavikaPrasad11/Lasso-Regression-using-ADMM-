# ADMM: Lasso Regression vs Decision Tree

This repository contains an implementation of the **Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)** for Lasso Regression and compares its performance with Decision Tree Regression.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
- **Lasso Regression**: Uses ADMM for optimization with L1 regularization.
- **Decision Tree Regression**: Used as a benchmark comparison.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy,Precision ROC AUC.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included
- `ADMM.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook implementing ADMM for Lasso and Decision Tree comparison.

## ðŸš€ Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/malavikaPrasad11/ADMM_Lasso_vs_DecisionTree.git
   cd Lasso Regression Using ADMM
